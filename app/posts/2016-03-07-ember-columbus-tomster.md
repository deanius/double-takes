As part of our involvement with our local development communities, we are proud
to join with the [Ember Columbus](http://embercolumbus.com/) meetup to sponsor
the
creation of a new [Tomster](http://emberjs.com/tomster/)!

The Ember Columbus Tomster embraces Columbus' and Ohio's long and storied
connection with American football. As the current home of
the [Pro Football Hall of Fame](http://www.profootballhof.com/),
the [Cleveland Browns](http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/),
the [Cincinnati Bengals](http://www.bengals.com/),
and of course Columbus' own [Ohio State Buckeyes](http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/osu-m-footbl-body.html),
Ohio is recognized around the world as a key cultural center of American football.

The Pro Football Hall of Fame is located in Canton, Ohio partly because the
American Professional Football Association was formed there in 1920. That league
had its named changed to the National Football League two years later. Nine Ohio
cities (Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, LaRue,
Portsmouth, and Toledo) have been home to NFL teams, more than any other state.
Portsmouth in particular had a successful NFL team that ultimately had to move
due to the Great Depression. The team was sold to a businessman in Detroit,
where it remains today as the [Detroit Lions](http://www.detroitlions.com/).

We're proud to embrace Ohio's current and historic ties to the game of
American football with this new Tomster. If you'd like a sticker of your own
football-playing Ember Columbus  Tomster, keep an eye out for me at
[EmberConf](http://emberconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon later this month
(March 28-30, 2016)!
