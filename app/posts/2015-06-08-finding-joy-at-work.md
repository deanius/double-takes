Starting your own business is probably the most risky and stress ridden path to Joy that you can imagine. Fortunately, you don't have to follow in my footsteps to find Joy at Work. This talk covers many of the challenges, mistakes, and some successes that I've had in my pursuit of Joy over the last 15 years of my career.

The [video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOoULTXN75o) was recorded during my presentation at [self.conference 2015](http://selfconference.org) on May 29th, 2015. The slides can be viewed [on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/toddkaufman/finding-joy-at-work).
