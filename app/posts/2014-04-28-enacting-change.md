Now that the weekend is over, I'm sure many of the people at [KalamazooX](http://www.kalamazoox.org) on Saturday will approach their careers this week with a renewed sense of purpose. If you haven't been to KalX, you really need to check it out because it is a great, single day conference focused on the heart and soul of software developers. Every year speakers share deep, personal, insightful, and meaningful stories that inspire attendees to seek significant change in their own lives.

Until the sessions of the 2014 edition of KalamazooX are out, hopefully this talk I gave there in 2013 on 'Enacting Change' will be of some benefit to you.

Also, here are the slides, hosted on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/toddkaufman/enacting-change):
