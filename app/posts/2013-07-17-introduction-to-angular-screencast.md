# overview

This is the first of a series of screencasts focused on AngularJS; in it you will walk through building a sample application with AngularJS to learn some of the basics along with some commentary that contrasts it with jQuery / Backbone.JS, this episode covers:

* Creating smaller cohesive groups of functionality with [angular.module](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/module)
* Adjusting page transitions and routing via the [$routeProvider](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$routeProvider)
* The benefits and use of two way data binding
* Avoiding DOM manipulation code using dynamic behavior and [$scope](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope)
* Decomposing applications with declarative UI code and imperative application code
* Extending the semantics of HTML with [directives](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive) and building custom directives.
* Angulars [jqLite](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element) facilities
* Facilities for [dependency injection](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di) in AngularJS
