Are you overwhelmed by JavaScript framework fatigue? Do you wish for the benefits
of the newest front-end advancements without continually rewriting your
application? Let's take a look at the latest version of Ember. We'll review the
tooling, debugging, and addons that have made Ember a growing choice for
innovative companies like Heroku, Travis CI, Square, and Nest. See how Ember
adopts the best from other frameworks while bringing us the future of JavaScript
today.

I shared this talk last week at [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org).
Since CodeMash has a technically diverse audience, the content is geared towards
someone who has heard of Ember but probably hasn't really tried it out.
It shows off some simple code and some of my favorite parts of the Ember ecosystem
in an attempt to get people interested in trying out Ember.
