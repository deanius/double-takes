The software industry spends a lot of time arguing about code quality. This is a talk about the flaws in our collective assumptions about "good code", and how that flawed reasoning has snowballed to deleterious effect in individuals, on teams, in our community, and throughout the industry. The [original, full-length abstract](https://gist.github.com/searls/8a50eb57e43e02335b06) tells a slightly fuller story about the origins of the talk.

The [video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6gel0eVeNw) was recorded by [Confreaks](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2015-sometimes-a-controller-is-just-a-controller) when presented at [RailsConf 2015](http://railsconf.com) on April 23. The slides can be viewed [on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/sometimes-a-controller-is-just-a-controller).
