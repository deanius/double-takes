[ES6 browser support][es6] is rising. Everyone and their mother is baling `var` from their code like their code is sinking under the weight of functional scoping. To anyone looking to learn JavaScript, it looks like some bizarre amalgamation of equal parts Cult of the New and Fear of the Unknown. How do you keep up? How do you jump in?

Let's dispell this myth, both for programmers currently using JavaScript and programmers familiar with other languages intersted in learning JavaScript. We're never done learning. Consider this an aid in cutting through some of the noise and focusing your learning around a few points—for now, at least. Afterward, you can add on as much as you like.

To be an effective JavaScript programmer—ES6 or otherwise—you _need_ to understand three of its core concepts: type coercion, closures, and `this`.

## Type coercion

Explanation.

## Closures

Explanation.

## `this` (Yes, `this`.)

Explanation.

I am fully aware that [ES6 arrow functions][arrow-functions] grant you the magical ability to stop caring about `this`. I am also fully aware that statement is a fabrication, a lie. It is true only if you write nothing but purely functional code, use arrow functions everywhere, and wish to forego the majority of modules on [npm][npm]. On the other hand, we can use a module like [traverse][traverse] (with its judicious use of `this`) to solve the problem at hand, and move on.
