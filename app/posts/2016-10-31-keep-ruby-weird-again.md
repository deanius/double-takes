The [video above](https://vimeo.com/189525997) was recorded by a campaign
tracker at the private Ruby fundraising event, [Keep Ruby
Weird](http://keeprubyweird.com) on October 28, 2016, in the final days of the
campaign.

The video depicts known JavaScript agitant [Justin
Searls](https://twitter.com/searls), who spoke for approximately 27 minutes at
the rally with a message that advocated restoring Ruby to its former prominence
in the open source software community. While the content of the speech contained
pointed populist rhetoric, it did not present any specific policy proposals.

Opponents to Ruby have raised concerns that the strong language used by Searls
will only embolden Ruby's most radical proponents to take action against
JavaScript, the open, standards-based language of the Future™.

Sources in the campaign say that prominent JavaScript leaders are alarmed,
fearing that the Ruby community's counter-cultural message could attract
developers frustrated by JavaScript's slow-moving, deliberate standards bodies
to move the web forward. Campaign officials worry that if a cohesive movement
organizes around a non-JavaScript language, it could set back their goal of
establishing a new world order in which 100% of new software across the world is
finally written in JavaScript.

*Test Double does not endorse the contents of this video and Searls has been
placed on paid conference speaking leave, pending the outcome of an internal
investigation.*

A transcript of the event follows:

<pre class="transcript">
[00:00:24.033] > Brandon: Ok. While
[00:00:27.033] Justin is setting up. This is Justin
[00:00:30.033] Searls. Does everyone know Justin? Hi Justin!
[00:00:33.033] > Justin: Hello.
[00:00:36.033] Are you guys ready to hear a talk?
[00:00:39.033] You believe that you're
[00:00:42.033] ready for my talk?
[00:00:45.033] Because I guarantee you are not.
[00:00:51.033] > Brandon: Alright. So here is
[00:00:54.033] the real fact about someone who is not Justin
[00:00:57.033] This person, joined the Army
[00:01:00.033] to rappel out of helicopters and shoot wire
[00:01:03.033] guided missiles at tanks. It's a true
[00:01:06.033] fact, but it is not true about Justin so far as I know
[00:01:21.033] So, most people don't know this about Justin
[00:01:24.033] But,
[00:01:27.033] he tweets. On the Internet
[00:01:30.033] This is a little know fact about Justin
[00:01:33.033] Is that he says things on Twitter
> Justin: hello…
[00:01:36.033] > Brandon: And, he, umm
> Justin: I'm a nice guy, I swear
[00:01:39.033] > Brandon: Alright, I have a fake
[00:01:44.933] He once tweeted a rant so powerful that he made the
[00:01:47.933] fail whale cry
[00:01:50.933] > Justin: This is a young crowd. I don't know if
[00:01:54.133] That was back when Twitter was written with Ruby
[00:02:00.133] > Brandon: Everybody, Justin Searls, who is
[00:02:03.133] really great.
[00:02:09.133] > Justin: Alright, just gotta get set up here. It's a
[00:02:12.133] complicated talk
[00:02:15.133] One complication is that I'm not going
[00:02:18.133] myself.
[00:02:21.133] I'm going to give this talk as somebody else.
[00:02:27.133] Button this up
[00:02:30.133] And, we're off!
[00:02:33.133] Woo!
[00:02:36.133] What a great room, Austin—hands down—
[00:02:39.133] one of my favorite cities. I was telling
[00:02:42.133] how TREMENDOUS the crowds in
[00:02:45.133] Thank you Brandon, he's a really nice
               guy isn't he? Thank you Brandon!
[00:02:48.133] Alright, please
[00:02:51.133] live-tweet all of your grievance to
               @searls
[00:02:57.133] Alright. Alright
[00:03:00.133] Oh No!
[00:03:03.133] > Audience: Bum Mic!
               > Justin: I got a bum mic?
[00:03:06.133] Oh, right, yeah
[00:03:09.133] This is a
[00:03:12.133] dongle conspiracy
[00:03:15.133] It's rigged, yeah!
[00:03:18.133] Now it just fell out
[00:03:21.133] We're going to start this one over
[00:03:27.133] Now we'll try this way. Ok, so
[00:03:30.133] let's just call that a do-over
[00:03:36.133] Just ordered the new MacBook Pro, so
[00:03:42.133] what just happened?
[00:03:54.133] Woo! Alright! Got all the nerves out!
[00:03:57.133] So, yeah, everyone please live-tweet
[00:04:00.133] your grievances to @searls and I will
[00:04:03.133] most terrible things that you say.
[00:04:06.133] developers, my company, Test Double,
[00:04:09.133] are the best of the best
[00:04:12.133] I stand before you today
[00:04:15.133] to deliver (It's okay, it's intentionally
               black)
[00:04:18.133] to deliver a very simple
[00:04:21.133] message. Ruby's heroes have failed
[00:04:24.133] Ruby
[00:04:27.133] is a SPECTACULAR language, but
[00:04:30.133] other language, Ruby has always been
[00:04:33.133] But today their ineffective, spineless leadership
[00:04:36.133] threatens the very survival of Ruby
[00:04:39.133] who can save it. Together we are going
[00:04:42.133] our language back. This goes all
[00:04:45.133] the way back, folks, to how Ruby was
[00:04:48.133] In the beginning—unintentional black
[00:04:51.133] There was Matz.
[00:04:54.133] Some people, tell me that Matz is a
[00:04:57.133] Which, I think, is fantastic
[00:05:00.133] The Japanese love me
[00:05:03.133] I am told he was very nice, but that
[00:05:06.133] for him to become Ruby King. Matz
[00:05:09.133] weak it took a decade for Ruby to
[00:05:12.133] Seriously! Thanks to Matz's weak
[00:05:15.133] leadership, we became dependent
[00:05:18.133] heroes. First, came pragmatic Dave
[00:05:21.133] Thomas and Andy Hunt, who wrote
               a very long (and very
[00:05:24.133] boring) book about Ruby and pickaxes
[00:05:27.133] Now this book showed how
[00:05:30.133] Ruby is, but Prag Dave and Prog Andy
[00:05:33.133] lined their pockets building a corrupt
[00:05:36.133] that today is the biggest source of
[00:05:39.133] biased technology books on the planet
[00:05:42.133] Later, "cheeky" Chad Fowler and
               "Jolly" Jim
[00:05:45.133] Weirich—so called "community
               organizers"
[00:05:48.133] went on to create a national ruby
               conference. And together
[00:05:51.133] they started a service called RubyGems
[00:05:54.133] spread their lies and propaganda
[00:05:57.133] easily. "Jolly" Jim went so
[00:06:00.133] far as to make a CORRUPT tool called
[00:06:03.133] force us to build gems how he wanted
[00:06:06.133] The corrupt heroes created RubyGems
[00:06:09.133] open borders, letting in hippies like
[00:06:12.133] Whacky _why and D-List DHH
[00:06:15.133] And they've been flooding in ever
[00:06:18.133] _why acted like the purpose of Ruby
[00:06:21.133] to make art—he had no respect for
[00:06:24.133] He yanked all of his gems, which was
[00:06:27.133] totally unprofessional and NOT NICE
[00:06:30.133] Total Disaster. D-List DHH was so
[00:06:33.133] desperate to have an MVC framework
[00:06:36.133] that he ported Java's Struts as
[00:06:39.133] And, personally, I prefer frameworks
[00:06:42.133] that weren't ported
[00:06:45.133] But soon, things settled down. The
[00:06:48.133] receded. Ruby entered its golden age
[00:06:51.133] Developers were unbelievably
[00:06:54.133] In no time at all we built hugely
[00:06:57.133] companies (also Daily Deal
[00:07:00.133] Coupon Sites) and it was
[00:07:03.133] all thanks to Ruby. Ruby was
[00:07:06.133] winning. Every new startup was using
               Rails, even
[00:07:09.133] if their staff had no clue
               how to write Ruby. It
[00:07:12.133] didn't matter, Ruby's poll numbers
[00:07:15.133] Every developer on earth was either
[00:07:18.133] jealous of people writing Ruby. And
[00:07:21.133] those days. I wrote a lot of skinny
[00:07:24.133] back then, let me tell you. In fact,
[00:07:27.133] that my Ruby was the cleanest code
               they'd ever seen
[00:07:30.133] We need to get back to that Ruby
[00:07:33.133] But soon, the establishment venture
[00:07:36.133] wanted to change Ruby.
[00:07:39.133] They wanted "Enterprise" and
[00:07:42.133] weak-kneed heroes were all
[00:07:45.133] "Jumpy" José Valim worked
[00:07:48.133] thread-safe. The traitor, Zed Shaw,
[00:07:51.133] made the Mongrel server fast
[00:07:54.133] Aloof Yehuda made bundler, a hostile
[00:07:57.133] takeover of your dependency
[00:08:00.133] And everyone's favorite,
               "Chicken" Tenderlove
[00:08:03.133] Spent years of his life
[00:08:06.133] rewriting the slow and confusing
[00:08:09.133] for Rails's ActiveRecord,
[00:08:12.133] create MASSIVE enterprise SQL
[00:08:15.133] so fast that we didn't even
[00:08:18.133] if we should. But now that Ruby
[00:08:21.133] is mature, your heroes got bored
[00:08:24.133] you for other languages.
               We're left with
[00:08:27.133] B-Tier heroes too low energy to
[00:08:30.133] like Terence Lee and
[00:08:33.133] With our heroes gone
[00:08:36.133] Ruby isn't winning anymore
[00:08:39.133] language and it's time to take action
[00:08:42.133] As a result, I, Justin A. Searls am
[00:08:45.133] calling for a total and complete
[00:08:48.133] Heroes switching to Elixir and Rust
[00:08:51.133] can figure out what the hell is going on
[00:08:57.133] We need to start planning for
[00:09:00.133] And if you support me, we can
[00:09:03.133] Make Ruby Great Again
[00:09:06.133] We have to look beyond the hero
               system, folks. Their
[00:09:09.133] phony loyalty to a language as
[00:09:12.133] is a disgrace. And you know the
               worst part?
[00:09:15.133] Heroes have known this for
[00:09:18.133] Here's what a left-wing, agile
[00:09:21.133] school called Extremist Programming
[00:09:24.133] They're not willing to call it that
               but let's be honest, it's
[00:09:27.133] Extremist programming. Here's what
[00:09:30.133] had to say. "Heroes go it
[00:09:33.133] alone, working long hours
[00:09:36.133] accomplish what others think is
[00:09:39.133] The result is unrealistic expectations by
[00:09:42.133] management and inevitably results
[00:09:45.133] SPIRAL as the whole team falls further
[00:09:48.133] and further behind. That's the ballgame
[00:09:51.133] folks. Heroes knew that they
[00:09:54.133] death spiral and yet they did nothing
[00:09:57.133] Now some of our Ruby heroes,
[00:10:00.133] are good people. Many did
[00:10:03.133] decent work for the language,
[00:10:06.133] addicted to your retweets
[00:10:09.133] fees, they closed the door on us. Ruby
[00:10:12.133] heroes became the ultimate insiders
[00:10:15.133] Heroes hid behind shadowy
[00:10:18.133] "The NIH" to explain why we should
[00:10:21.133] gems instead of writing our own. They
[00:10:24.133] led our thoughts, and they told us
[00:10:27.133] that we couldn't be heroes too.
               And then *poof*
[00:10:30.133] Those same heroes abandoned us for
[00:10:33.133] newer, more attractive languages.
               And now we've
[00:10:36.133] become helpless without them.
[00:10:39.133] And by the way, somebody needs to
               say this and I'm not afraid
[00:10:42.133] to say it. Ruby hero, D-List DHH
[00:10:45.133] was the WORST abuser of SemVer
[00:10:48.133] in the history of programming
[00:10:51.133] And rails-core was a total enabler
[00:10:54.133] let me be clear, if Rails won't
[00:10:57.133] lock down their versioning,
[00:11:00.133] them up.
[00:11:03.133] The establishment
[00:11:06.133] venture capitalists that once
[00:11:09.133] are now shipping our jobs
[00:11:12.133] nobody makes things in Ruby anymore
[00:11:15.133] We need to send them a message
               They're afraid of
[00:11:18.133] your power. They know that I'm the
[00:11:21.133] bring jobs back to Ruby. The venture
[00:11:24.133] capitalists in their ivory
[00:11:27.133] open plan offices that rigged
[00:11:30.133] the mainstream media
[00:11:33.133] against Ruby, if you open a hacker
[00:11:36.133] newspaper the entire front page
[00:11:39.133] app in anything but Ruby
               Elixir, Go
[00:11:42.133] Elm, Clojure, Rust, and of course
[00:11:45.133] Node.js and React. But for Ruby
[00:11:48.133] to survive, these other languages
[00:11:51.133] It's as simple as that. Our
[00:11:54.133] have let these other languages
               walk all over us, and
[00:11:57.133] some Ruby heroes are trying to
[00:12:00.133] secret that they are in fact only
[00:12:03.133] They falsely claim that I have
[00:12:06.133] Rubocop report.
[00:12:09.133] But these are bald-faced lies
[00:12:12.133] release my full, unabridged
[00:12:15.133] But, unfortunately, I am currently
[00:12:18.133] under a code audit, which
[00:12:21.133] for some reason happens to me
               every single year, I get audited
[00:12:24.133] I'd be stupid to release them until
[00:12:27.133] the code audit is complete. Only
[00:12:30.133] Rubocop report while under audit.
[00:12:33.133] But I would gladly release
[00:12:36.133] as soon as Node.js returns the
[00:12:39.133] 30.000 deleted e-mails that
[00:12:42.133] says were lost because I
               didn't call catch at the end
[00:12:45.133] of a Promise chain
[00:12:48.133] Unbelievable. Node.js
[00:12:51.133] Such a nasty runtime.
[00:12:57.133] Our heroes left us out in
               the cold, but I
[00:13:00.133] guarantee I know more about
[00:13:03.133] than all of Ruby's heroes put together
[00:13:06.133] I'll go to the other languages and
[00:13:09.133] Ruby can start winning again. In fact
[00:13:12.133] I've learned that Ruby hero
               Jumpy José Valim
[00:13:15.133] is the founder of Elixir
[00:13:18.133] And because he's a hero,
[00:13:21.133] Totally shameless. Jumpy Jose
[00:13:24.133] he has a secret plan to destroy Ruby
[00:13:27.133] But, can anyone imagine
               using Elixir? No way.
[00:13:30.133] It doesn't look very productional to me
[00:13:33.133] You know, I saw
[00:13:36.133] some Elixir when I walked by a coworker's
               screen. I wasn't impressed.
[00:13:39.133] It didn't feel as
[00:13:42.133] free as Ruby. Ruby was great
[00:13:45.133] We didn't need heroes to tell
               us how to code. In Ruby's golden
[00:13:48.133] age, we felt free to write whatever
[00:13:51.133] wanted. And we need to realize
[00:13:54.133] stranger together.
[00:13:57.133] A lot of people don't know this,
[00:14:00.133] weirdness. Our heroes' failed
               policies have left Ruby's
[00:14:03.133] weird reserves at historic lows
[00:14:06.133] use code words like "mature"
[00:14:09.133] creativity that they deem
               too weird. Heroes
[00:14:12.133] like "Shady" Sandi Metz would
[00:14:15.133] "Syntactically Correct" way to write
               Ruby, but
[00:14:18.133] I talk to a lot of developers
[00:14:21.133] of all of this syntactical correctness
[00:14:24.133] Ruby heroes called our
[00:14:27.133] creativity weird because
[00:14:30.133] wouldn't need them anymore. They
[00:14:33.133] We didn't need them. Anyone
[00:14:36.133] gems. In fact, I made two
[00:14:39.133] Tremendous gems. Code climate
[00:14:42.133] loved them. If we're going
[00:14:45.133] to save Ruby, we need to rediscover
[00:14:48.133] first step: stop listening to
[00:14:51.133] Other than me. Keep listening to me.
[00:14:54.133] Some people are saying—and I'm not
               saying this—but some people
[00:14:57.133] I've been told—that we should
[00:15:00.133] Heroes like Chicken Tenderlove,
[00:15:03.133] Ryan Davis, Cranky Gary Bernhardt
[00:15:06.133] And by the way, since Chicken
[00:15:09.133] are the founding members of
               Seattle.rb
[00:15:12.133] Something needs to be said,
               folks. Most Rubyists
[00:15:15.133] are too afraid to call
               Seattle.rb what it is
[00:15:18.133] Radical Parenthetical Terrorism
[00:15:23.033] It's just horrible More
[00:15:26.033] omitted and killed by Rubyists in
[00:15:29.033] in the world. And our heroes
[00:15:32.033] did nothing. If you support me
[00:15:35.033] I will deport Seattle.rb to
[00:15:41.033] Without heroes, we'll all need
[00:15:44.033] to make Ruby great again. Post
[00:15:47.033] Record screencasts. Start a weird
[00:15:50.033] And stop reading the lies in The
[00:15:53.033] that tell you Ruby isn't great.
               They're liars
[00:15:56.033] all of them. And I've been doing
               this for years, by the way
[00:15:59.033] Ask anyone, they will tell you
[00:16:02.033] writes the wordiest blogs and
[00:16:05.033] screencasts. And have you seen any
               of my other talks?
[00:16:08.033] Nobody makes more slides at Ruby
[00:16:11.033] than me, nobody. I make the most
[00:16:14.033] But I'm just one person and
               that's not good enough
[00:16:17.033] to slow Ruby's demise. We all
[00:16:20.033] step up and say what's really
               on our minds. So if you have an idea
[00:16:23.033] Write your own gem. You
[00:16:26.033] publish on the blogs. And if you're
[00:16:29.033] Argue about it with others
[00:16:32.033] and on The Failing Hacker News
               comment section, because if we
[00:16:35.233] can't show that Ruby is a strong
               language, the other
[00:16:38.233] languages will keep walking all over us
[00:16:41.233] Back when Ruby was winning
[00:16:44.233] If someone wanted to learn to
               make a new web app, people would
[00:16:47.233] assume that they should learn
               Ruby, but now people learn
[00:16:50.233] to program computers and don't even
               know what Ruby is, they simply don't
[00:16:53.233] know. These smug, elitist
[00:16:56.233] languages are ignoring you and
[00:16:59.233] and to make Ruby great again, we
[00:17:02.233] have to make deals with
[00:17:05.233] Starting with the most popular:
[00:17:08.233] JavaScript.
[00:17:11.233] JavaScript is a total
[00:17:14.233] lightweight. Like a lot of you, I
[00:17:17.233] understand why JavaScript is
[00:17:20.233] You want my opinion?
[00:17:23.233] Tops.
[00:17:26.233] Maybe a 5, if it loses the semi-colons
[00:17:31.033] And JavaScript is very weak on types
[00:17:34.033] Unbelievable how weak on types
               it is. Have you ever tried to compare
[00:17:37.033] two Dates? I will be very strong
[00:17:40.033] on trade with JavaScript,
[00:17:43.033] wealth. Wealth like you wouldn't
               believe. We have good testing
[00:17:46.033] We have conventions over
               configuration. We have
[00:17:49.033] the path of least surprise, which,
               if you've never been there, is
[00:17:52.033] a beautiful path. The best path.
[00:17:55.033] Our weak and ineffective heroes foolishly
[00:17:58.033] tried to hide JavaScript from us for years
[00:18:01.033] RJS. Turbolinks. ActionCable
[00:18:04.933] This weak, isolationist strategy
[00:18:08.933] And is leading to Ruby dying out
[00:18:11.433] And that's why I propose we go to
[00:18:14.433] good leader would do: negotiate
[00:18:17.433] Ruby can start winning again
[00:18:20.433] Instead of continuing
               D-List DHH's failed
[00:18:23.433] policies of mixing JavaScript into
               our server-side
[00:18:26.433] HTML, I am going to Build. A. Wall
[00:18:30.033] Between our Ruby and our JavaScript
[00:18:33.033] Oh, don't worry, we'll make JavaScript
[00:18:36.233] Pay for all the HTML
[00:18:39.233] Ruby will provide—quiet generously
[00:18:42.233] APIs, but JavaScript is what
[00:18:45.233] Ruby web apps and it will pay to fix it
[00:18:48.233] We need to be tough on JavaScript
[00:18:50.633] But I'll also be very very fair, much more
[00:18:53.633] fair than JavaScript has been
               to us, let me tell you
[00:18:56.533] Look what they did last time we
[00:18:59.533] By giving them CoffeeScript
[00:19:02.533] They stole all CoffeeScript's good ideas
[00:19:05.233] And they totally choked!
[00:19:08.233] is a joke. Their arrow functions
[00:19:11.233] JavaScript's secret cabal
[00:19:14.233] The TC-39 is a total disaster
[00:19:17.233] Unbelievable. And now some
[00:19:20.233] Have claimed that my ultimate
[00:19:23.233] goal is to transpile Ruby into JavaScript
[00:19:26.233] These are heinous lies and
[00:19:29.233] from the truth. And, besides,
[00:19:32.233] JavaScript wouldn't be my first choice
               as a transpilation target, let me tell you
[00:19:37.733] It's not.
[00:19:40.133] So people say that Ruby's dead,
               but you're all here
[00:19:43.133] Aren't you? Look around you in
               this room. You came to this rally
[00:19:46.133] today because you believe Ruby
[00:19:49.133] But it doesn't feel safe to
[00:19:52.133] If you're caught using Ruby
               in public, others will
[00:19:55.133] attack your first amendment rights
[00:19:59.833]  But we can fight back
[00:20:02.833] There's a silent majority that
[00:20:07.433] And the system is rigged, folks
[00:20:09.833] Establishment venture capitalists
               don't want you to believe Ruby
[00:20:12.833] has a future. They want teams
               to build over-engineered
[00:20:15.833] massively complex micro Node.js
[00:20:18.833] services and React web site apps
[00:20:21.633] for their unproven startups in
[00:20:24.633] their pyramid funding schemes.
[00:20:27.033] They want to ensure that it takes
[00:20:30.033] taxi car app. Numerous years to
[00:20:33.033] sync a directory of files to a server
[00:20:36.033] The establishment venture capitalists
[00:20:39.033] development is, but they don't
[00:20:42.033] They want it to be huge.
[00:20:45.033] Their entire empire is threatened
               by Ruby's productivity
[00:20:48.233] I'm in business, I know this better
[00:20:51.233] The VCs are so desperate that
               they've been digging through my
[00:20:54.233] old repos—horrible people.
[00:20:57.233] So my staff have asked me that I make
[00:21:00.233] before we continue:
[00:21:03.233] *ahem* I apologize
[00:21:06.233] for using domain specific
[00:21:09.233] project from 11 years ago
[00:21:12.233] It was a foolish decision.
[00:21:15.233] My use of Ruby DSLs has become
[00:21:18.233] from the issues that really matter
[00:21:21.233] In truth, it was just locker room code
[00:21:24.233] That's all it was
[00:21:26.033] Programmers when working on private
[00:21:29.033] DSLs all the time. In fact, even
[00:21:32.033] Tenderlove used RSpec on a project
[00:21:35.033] as last year. Truly disgusting.
[00:21:38.033] And I gotta tell you I don't
[00:21:41.033] I think Ruby's still really, really popular
[00:21:44.033] Everybody I talk to loves Ruby
[00:21:47.033] use Ruby all around the world
[00:21:49.333] But Ruby teams are just too busy
[00:21:52.933] and making tons of money to stop
[00:21:55.533] comment about it on Hacker News
[00:21:58.533] If after all I've done, you don't help
[00:22:02.233] This will have been the biggest
[00:22:05.233] energy in my life. If you don't save
[00:22:08.233] Ruby after this, Austin, I'll be honest
[00:22:11.233] I'll never forgive you. I'll never come back
[00:22:14.933] But irregardless, I will totally and
[00:22:17.933] graciously accept the result of
               your team's election for its
[00:22:21.533] next programming language.
               If. It's. Ruby.
[00:22:27.333] OK, hat's off!
[00:22:30.333] Whew!
[00:22:36.333] I can think so much
[00:22:39.333] more clearly now
[00:22:42.333] Let's bring it back to reality
[00:22:45.333] Where I co-own a serious company
[00:22:48.733] And which hopes you all understand
[00:22:56.833] So you're probably a little
[00:22:59.833] Do I think that Ruby's heroes
               are bad people?
[00:23:02.833] Of course not. Some of my
[00:23:06.333] Ok, seriously, I'm done. That was the last one
[00:23:10.233] I was—like Trump—obsessed being
[00:23:13.533] validated by others and I made it my
[00:23:16.533] myself. I wanted to see what it felt
               like to be on the inside. Overall,
[00:23:19.533] it's been a fantastic experience, if
[00:23:22.533] But, when I hear that Ruby isn't
[00:23:25.533] It's our outsider/insider system
[00:23:28.533] that always stood out to me as wrong
[00:23:31.133] Why is there this huge divide between
[00:23:33.633] and the people who consume them?
               Because we're a very small pond
[00:23:36.633] in the grand scheme of things, and
               we've just stocked it with some
[00:23:39.033] relatively big fish. So, that
[00:23:42.033] But, I don't think we've done the job
[00:23:45.033] problems our system of Ruby heroes
               is creating.
[00:23:48.033] Because, I can tell you, I've met dozens
[00:23:51.033] in my travels, and I've seen what the
[00:23:54.233] that comes from looking to a small,
[00:23:57.733] solution to every problem we face
[00:24:00.733] Worse, we have this habit of
[00:24:03.733] they're very common in Ruby and
[00:24:06.933] "Katie wanted to do this, but we told
               her no because Sandi's book says
[00:24:11.433] …to do it that way instead". These
[00:24:14.433] suck the joy of programming. "Sam,
               built his own…
[00:24:17.433] module of plain old Ruby objects,
[00:24:20.433] deleting them and showing
[00:24:23.433] Now Trump-Searls has a point
[00:24:26.433] Because, as Ruby became mature
[00:24:29.633] Thoughtleaders run on retweets and
[00:24:32.633] maturity is a known retweet allergen
[00:24:36.033] So they moved on. And early on,
[00:24:39.033] assumed when they came to Ruby—
[00:24:41.633] keeping relevant was going to be
               somebody else's job, but now if we
[00:24:44.433] do nothing, I think that eventually Ruby
[00:24:47.433] cute-little scripting language status
[00:24:50.433] So if you want to do that,
[00:24:53.433] heroes with new heroes, I don't think
               that's going to work, because Ruby's
[00:24:56.133] not the hottest language in the world
               anymore. Passively attracting
[00:24:59.133] tons and tons of new talent. Today,
               that language is called JavaScript.
[00:25:02.133] So we have to look within to chart Ruby's future
[00:25:04.633] Ruby has its work cut out for it
               and I'd rather have you
[00:25:07.633] all become heroes than just select
[00:25:10.633] So, it'll be a steep climb, but
               I don't think it's insurmountable
[00:25:13.633] You look at languages like
               Node.js & Elixir, they
[00:25:16.633] have really fast async I/O, and that's
[00:25:19.633] Rust and Go are just really fast, period
[00:25:22.633] and that's something that Ruby could
               do better. But if you look at all the other
[00:25:25.333] popular languages, there are
[00:25:28.333] we love about Ruby. Ruby still has
[00:25:31.533] We have tools and culture that's
[00:25:34.533] programmer happiness and
               productivity. Promoting
[00:25:37.533] obviousness via the path of least
               surprise. Consistency
[00:25:40.533] through well-considered conventions.
               Carefully-designed
[00:25:43.533] value-based test suites. All
[00:25:46.533] that represents a niche that's
[00:25:49.533] even if it's currently out of fashion,
[00:25:52.533] application development is not
[00:25:55.533] scale; if anything all of these
               innovations we've seen in DevOps
[00:25:58.533] kind have taken Ruby's performance
[00:26:01.533] Neither is the hardest problem having
[00:26:04.533] In fact, dependency churn is this
               under-appreciated tax
[00:26:07.533] on a lot of teams' productivity.
[00:26:10.533] been long-term maintainability
[00:26:13.533] suited, I think, to show
[00:26:16.533] more maintainable applications. Ruby's
[00:26:19.533] gives us a certain empathy
[00:26:22.533] Ruby helps Rubyists create
               thoughtful designs, thoughtful
[00:26:25.533] tests. And the conventions are strong
[00:26:28.533] portable from project to project
[00:26:31.533] We're already seeing a ton of legacy
               Node.js apps
[00:26:34.533] Project teams are asking
               "What just happened?"
[00:26:37.533] "How did we get to this big ball of
               yarn?" Highly maintainable
[00:26:40.533] and understandable Ruby could
[00:26:43.533] potential answer for teams like that
               but we have to show up, so my
[00:26:46.533] final plea is that if you believe
[00:26:49.533] for some reason, tell people about it
               blog about long-term
[00:26:52.533] maintainability, even if it's a boring
               topic. Compare Ruby to other
[00:26:55.533] ecosystems. Screencast tutorials
               about design lessons you're learning
[00:26:58.533] Even if other people have said them
               before, how you say it will be
[00:27:01.533] different. Find an organization like
[00:27:04.533] Girls Code and show them the gentle
               on-ramp of Ruby's
[00:27:07.533] syntax and community. And I don't
[00:27:10.533] the Failing Hacker News, but if
               you're there
[00:27:13.533] stand up for Ruby. Hacker News drives
[00:27:16.533] the tech that companies use,
[00:27:19.533] And Ruby is rarely mentioned there
[00:27:22.533] anymore, because it's not new and
               trendy. So the solution just can't be
[00:27:25.533] Turmp-like tribalism. It's not us-
[00:27:28.533] -vs-them. Let's all be polyglots.
               The only way we're going to
[00:27:31.533] draw in outsiders. So when you work
               in another language, like JavaScript
[00:27:34.533] empathize! Be kind. Don't assume
[00:27:37.533] have the same lessons that you
               learned doing Ruby. You have
[00:27:40.533] valuable things to teach them just like
[00:27:43.533] So, anyway, that's what we try to do
[00:27:46.533] at my company Test Double. We like
               Ruby a lot, but we also
[00:27:49.533] engage with people in other languages
[00:27:52.533] where they already are. And we're
               looking for help.
[00:27:55.533] So if you want to work with us, Test
               Double's always hiring,
[00:27:58.533] always interviewing. If you want
               to Make Ruby Great Again™
[00:28:01.533] or Make JavaScript Great For The
               First Time™
[00:28:07.233] Shoot us an e-mail at
               join@testdouble.com. You know
[00:28:10.233] It's a real easy conversation. We
               don't start with a whiteboard exam
[00:28:13.233] We just talk to you about who you are
               What you like to do, how you like to work
[00:28:16.433] And then tell you how we work and see
[00:28:19.433] you wanna do.
               Also I have stickers.
[00:28:22.433] So I'll be around all evening. I got
[00:28:25.433] a bunch of Test Double stickers and I
[00:28:28.433] Great Again stickers, some are already
[00:28:31.433] at the sticker table in the back, but I've
[00:28:34.433] here, so I hope I get a chance to meet
               all of you today.
[00:28:37.433] Thanks so much for keeping it weird
[00:28:47.533] > Brandon: Thank you Justin. That was
[00:28:50.533]  problematic.
[00:28:56.533] I don't think I'm a millennial, because
[00:28:59.533] bad at detecting the line where people are
[00:29:02.533] ironically co-opting populist
[00:29:05.533] and just actually using it.
[00:29:08.533] Thank you Justin,
[00:29:11.533] You're a good dude.
