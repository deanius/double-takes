Testing software is hard. Maintaining a fast, comprehensible, and meaningful test
suite that can grow alongside an application for years is *really* hard.

In our experience working with dozens of teams, we've run into a bunch of the
same testing problems over and over again. This talk is an effort to analyze the
most common reasons that teams become disillusioned with their tests, and offer
some targeted advice to help teams prevent these problems from ever
materiaizing by tweaking their tools, workflow, and perspective.

The [video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6gel0eVeNw) was recorded at
[RubyConf 2015](http://rubyconf.org) on November, 15, 2015 (incidentally, Test
Double's 4th anniversary!).
