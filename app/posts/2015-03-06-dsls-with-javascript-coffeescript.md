# Overview

Web developers are integration specialists—tying plugins, scripts and frameworks together into a web application that works. Thinking in terms of abstractions—by condensing many low-level ideas into fewer high-level ideas—allows us to simplify our code and reason about it with less cognitive overhead.

In this screencast, recorded at [Prairie Dev Con 2015](prairiedevcon.com), we examine a few techniques for building abstractions on top of popular JavaScript frameworks by learning about Domain Specific Languages and bringing some convention to our code.
