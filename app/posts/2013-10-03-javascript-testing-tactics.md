  title: "A different approach to JavaScript testing"
  body: """
        This talk is the missing manual to writing great JavaScript tests. I'm
        very excited to share it with you, because I really believe it can change
        how you approach writing software; this journey certainly has for me.

This talk, as delivered at [DevReach](http://www.devreach.com) in Sofia, Bulgaria, is the culmination of years of practicing to write beautiful JavaScript tests that provide *just the right feedback* to prompt me to take actions which dramatically improve the design of my code. As a result of my singular focus, my approach is **very** different than what you'd find searching for a tutorial or a README about JavaScript testing, TDD, or unit testing in general.

It would make my day if you'd [watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHcEjAQ46Io) with an open mind and thoughtfully consider what about the approach I've arrived at might prove valuable in your own practice.

Here are the slides, hosted on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/javascript-testing-tactics):

Finally, you might have noticed that the slide deck was written in Markdown (as a wink to the fact that the talk was about advice that you *wouldn't* find in a README). So, naturally, [I've decided to post the entire talk's text as a README to Github](https://github.com/testdouble/javascript-testing-tactics/blob/master/README.md).
