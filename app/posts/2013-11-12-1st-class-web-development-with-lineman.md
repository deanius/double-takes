  title: "Making front-end development more delightful."
  body: """
        We think that teams will see better results if they segregate the front-end and the back-end of fat-client JavaScript web applications. This talk explains why this approach is desirable, describes the shortcomings of current front-end tooling, and shows how we're using Lineman to find happiness in the front-end today.
        """

This talk was delivered at [Øredev](http://www.oredev.com) in Malmö, Sweden. It was a joy to have an entire week to focus on how to best discuss the trends we're experiencing in fat-client JavaScript. As a result, I feel like I finally landed at a sufficient explanation of what [Lineman](http://www.linemanjs.com) is and why it might serve you well. You can [find it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/KERJkJNV5nI).

Here are the slides, hosted on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/1st-class-web-development-with-lineman):
