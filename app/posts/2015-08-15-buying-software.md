I get to talk to a lot of people about what we do at Test Double and I’m constantly amazed by the number of interesting and unique challenges that face businesses from different industries. It seems like there should be off-the-shelf solutions for most of what people need after 40 or so years of commercial software sales, but existing solutions often don’t have the required features, they raise support concerns, or they require extensive customization to meet the needs of business customers. Companies then turn to agencies like ours, for a custom software solution.

Unfortunately, many companies use the same mindset for buying services that they would when purchasing packaged software (or pencils or staplers or other commodity products). This mindset can negatively impact the endeavor at every step along the way; leading buyers to select the wrong vendor, inhibit collaborative relationships, and build custom software that's _still_ a poor match for their needs. 

Because most businesses will go years between major custom software initiatives, it shouldn't come as a shock that few will have learned through experience how to build a successful partnership with a software services company. Meanwhile, as an agency, we're a part of this process dozens of times a year, albeit from the other side of the table. Here are a few of the pitfalls we see buyers run into and some of the advice we frequently give prospective clients to avoid them:

## Forcing a delivery date

When companies build a building or manufacture an item, they do so because there's no way to copy-paste physical things into existence. If that were possible, we'd see far fewer construction projects. Short of that, since most buildings and items have been fabricated many times previously, when companies build those things they can at least approach the project with a commodity mindset—costs can be compared and firm delivery dates can be predicted accurately.

Because it's so easy to analogize writing software to building physical things, we often forget that its intangible nature means we _can_ just copy-paste existing software. That fact eliminates the need for routine "construction projects", which have greatly informed how businesses practice project management. As a result, whenever anyone undertakes a custom software project, it's only because the software they need _has never been built before_. As opposed to fabricating a familiar physical item, custom software must be approached with a creative, open-ended mindset—costs can vary dramatically and delivery dates of fixed-functionality can't be estimated reliably.

If the problem a customer is trying to solve is already well understood, then the chances are that they can find something off-the-shelf that will do what they want. They won’t have much need for a firm like ours in that case. Assuming that what they need is actually is unique, then it is difficult at best for us to forecast when exactly everything they initially wanted will be done. The very uniqueness of the problem that drives clients to buying our services in the first place is the same thing that limits our ability to tell clients explicitly when we’ll be done. Instead, we try to guide our clients to focus on minimizing scope, reducing complexity, and eliminating risk throughout the process. By working iteratively in the open and communicating continuously, our creative process enables us to gradually narrow in on a realistic delivery date as the software is written.

## Fixing scope

Most companies start custom software projects with the wrong question. They ask first, “What things might we want this software to accomplish?”. Many people may see no issue with this question, but the devil is in the ambiguity. 

When we ask our business stakeholders and end-users for a list of every possible thing that some software should do, we get a response that is much more swiss army knife than screwdriver. And when we don’t refine the scope from all possibilities down to must-have essentials, we typically produce software that is expensive, difficult to maintain, and very hard to use. (See Sharepoint if you want a good example.) Brainstorming about possible features with end-users is a valuable activity, but assuming that all of the features discussed on day 1 are essential is a recipe for disaster. 

At Test Double, we work with customers to distill long lists of desired features into the core essentials in order to arrive at a minimum viable product. While we have a lot of tricks up our sleeve for identifying the most valuable aspects of a prospective system, it can be as simple as forcing ourselves to categorize features into critical, nice-to-have, and distraction buckets. Starting with only the critical features, the software is released very early on, and the team starts relentlessly soliciting user feedback to help determine what should be worked on next. What businesses initially predict will be the most valuable features often differ greatly from users' perspectives once they start using real, working software. As a result, adopting a process designed to leverage users' feedback is a necessary part of building valuable software.

> ToddNote: I wrote this line thinking about the above but it probably doesn't fit: "Once businesses are able to receive authentic feedback about their software, we find they usually spend more time refining the top two or three features than sweating the completion of requirement bullet point #43 from a (long-since forgotten) initial design doc."

## Thinking only of today

> ToddNote: in this section i liked the emphasis on focusing on the initial bill. the ancedote (that i didn't force in here b/c it's silly) that it made me think of is that of going to a restaurant. If I order a 32 ounce steak smothered in hot cheese sauce, I'm probably going to spend several minutes staring at the high cost of the restaurant tab, but what I should really be worried about is the enormous downstream health care costs I'm incurring—I don't even think about that.

Many clients tend to think that getting software into production is the finish line. Unfortunately, up to 80% of the cost of software development occurs beyond initial release. Many companies start to see defects, longer turnaround time on new features, and scalability concerns shortly after they push into production and call a project "done". 

Over time, companies come to view these expensive maintenance issues as irreparable, and they go about completely rewriting applications that have been deemed "legacy" after only a few years. If software service consumers want to focus on reducing their costs, wouldn’t they be better served by focusing on reducing maintenance costs and preventing legacy rewrites rather than focusing on the bill rate of the developers writing version one?

The challenge to customers is that it's difficult to evaluate how maintainable one software company's work will be versus another's. It's easy to compare potential partners by bill rate, however, so buyers tend to put undue emphasis on up-front cost comparisons. Test Double, meanwhile, is relentlessly committed to writing software carefully and deliberately enough to be easy to grow and maintain over the long term. That makes us a harder sell until buyers have come to appreciate (and often, unfortunately, the hard way) that fast and cheap solutions can quickly become money pits to maintain.

We spend a lot of time immersing ourselves in our clients' business domains, putting hard thought into finding simple approaches to complex problems, and writing a lot of automated tests to ensure our work functions soundly and is easy to change safely. That means we move at a more thoughtful and deliberate pace than most of our competition, and the software we deliver our clients is better for it, especially over the long-term as our software is changed to meet the future needs of its users.

Finally, we spend ample time to ensure our clients have a plan for operating and maintaining the software we deliver. We love working closely with our clients' engineers, and we're happy to facilitate smooth maintenance transitions by welcoming client developers into the fold, pair-programming with them and training them to carry the torch after we're gone. Finding a vendor with a focus on planning these transitions and with the skill to teach others how to maintain their code is key to ensuring a viable long term solution.

## Purchasing based on cost. 

When purchasing pencils, then it may make sense to base that purchase on the lowest cost per pencil. Pencils are, after all, fairly similar in regards to quality, efficiency, ease of use, and general value for the dollar. Software developers, unfortunately, are not. When procuring custom software development services, you are in essence buying software developers which vary wildly in quality, efficiency, ease of use, and general value for the dollar. 

Evaluating the aptitude of a software developer is hard, even for highly-experienced developers like ourselves.

People have touted and disputed the notion of a "10x developer
", but our experience tells us that there are massive variances in skill, communication, creativity, and professionalism among today's programmers—all of these attributes directly influence the quality of the custom software they can be expected to produce. 

Truly exceptional developers know:

*  When to challenge product owners on the features being discussed, and when to evaluate alternative solutions to the problems that _aren’t_ being discussed
* When to absorb the cost of adopting a new technology, and when chasing after a new-and-shiny technology won't be worthwhile
* When to spend time refactoring working code so that it's easier to change the next time someone looks at it, and when to defer clean-up tasks until more is known about how it might need to change in the future

Comparing two consultancies based solely on cost is easy, identifying the developers who excel at balancing the trade-offs above is hard. To better equip prospective clients to make the right decisions for their needs, we encourage them to take their time to get to know us before making a long time commitment. Further, because there's no better way to judge the competency of a developer than to work closely with them for a few months, we love when prospective clients ask to talk with others who've worked with us previously.

## Conclusion

Procuring custom software development is a challenging process and one that shouldn’t be undertaken blindly based using an RFP or other disconnected, commodity-mindset process. Hopefully companies realize that many of the pitfalls discussed above can be avoided by investing the time to collaborate closely with a software agency—first on a small commitment to establish trust, then on larger endeavors once the partnership proves fruitful.
