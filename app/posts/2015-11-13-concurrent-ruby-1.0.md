We are excited to announce that Double Agent [Jerry D'Antonio](http://twitter.com/jerrydantonio) has [released](https://rubygems.org/gems/concurrent-ruby) version 1.0 of [Concurrent Ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby)!

Concurrent Ruby is a robust suite of tools for building safe, reliable, performant concurrent applications in Ruby. It's being used by many projects including [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq), [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash), [Dynflow](https://github.com/Dynflow/dynflow/), [Volt](https://github.com/voltrb/volt), [Hamster](https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster), and [Pakyow](https://github.com/pakyow/pakyow), as well as many corporations including [Microsoft](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby) and [MX](https://github.com/mxenabled). The team is an international collaboration of more that 40 [contributors](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/graphs/contributors) from over 20 countries.

From Jerry:

> Our 1.0 release marks a huge milestone. With this release we've locked in the current APIs and are committed to supporting our work and our users for a long time to come. Projects can use these tools with confidence, knowing that they have the best concurrency tools available in Ruby--and a dedicated team working hard to continually improve them.
