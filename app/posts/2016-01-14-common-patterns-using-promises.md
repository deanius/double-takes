I gave [this talk][recording] a week ago at [CodeMash][].
I briefly explain the JavaScript promise API and then talk about good and bad patterns around promise code.

In the talk I refer to the [Promises/A+ spec][spec], which I encourage people to read.

The audience asked some insightful questions at the end.
Unfortunately I had to cut them because I did a poor job repeating for the microphone.
If you have questions about JavaScript promises, feel free to [tweet them at me][twitter].
