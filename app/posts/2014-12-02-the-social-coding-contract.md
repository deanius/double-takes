Social coding revolutionized how we share code with others. Bundler, npm, and Github made publishing and consuming code so convenient that our dependencies have become smaller and more numerous. Nowadays, most projects quickly resemble a Jenga tower, with layer upon layer of poorly understood single points of failure.

This talk is an opportunity to pause and reflect on our relationship with open source. Convenience and ego drive most open source adoption, but these shortsighted motivations raise long-term problems we need to clearly identify if we can ever hope to solve them. This presentation is just a first step in that direction.

The [video above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFRU6eQKp4Y&feature=youtu.be) was presented at RubyConf 2014 on November 19, 2014. The slides are [up on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/searls/the-social-coding-contract), as usual.
